Today:

Summary: I made a demo cache program!  Unfortunately Mr. Hirano and I realized that my code is kinda terrible so I'm going to delete it and start again tomorrow, with the lessons of today in mind, and hopefully a better structure.  I'm going to keep some of my code, probably, because a lot of it is salvagable, but it definitely needs work or maybe just deletion entirely.

largest lesson: I need to structure my programs before I start jumping in
difficulty: My computer's about to die!!!!
difficulty: I definitely misunderstood the goal of the project


change the couting of hit and miss to a variable in Cache
       in order to deal with read/write hitting stuph

DEAL WITH ADDRESS VS INDEX (simple find/replace, but decide what to rename as)

DIRTY BIT (DO NOT FORGET THIS)





maybe start over???
      now that I know that I'm supposed to just take the addresses and see the miss rate, instead of actually doing the whole memory thing
