Today:

Today I implemented not-most recently used as a replacement policy in the cache, as well as researching and implementing high-resolution timing.

Hardest challenge: Understanding the extremely complicated tutorial put out by Apple on how to understand one function, where to call it, and why.

Largest lesson: I've picked up a lot of random tidbits throughout my life that're going to help me when I'm a professional programmer!

deal with 2d array initialization between cache.h and cache.cpp
instead of the current vector<> thing


okay i do not use index at all
also offset?  what about that thing?  is that set-associative?  do I need it?
