Today:

Today I took a trip to Oracle, explored their data centers, and got halfway through implementing lru as a replacement policy.  I also worked out bugs with not-mru.

Greatest lesson: there's some great pho out by Oracle.

Biggest challenge: absorbing the sheer amount of information I got on the tour, or maybe dealing with the constant segmentation faults I keep getting, for whatever reason.

deal with 2d array initialization between cache.h and cache.cpp
instead of the current vector<> thing


okay i do not use index at all
also offset?  what about that thing?  is that set-associative?  do I need it?
