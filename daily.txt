Today:

Dear Mr. Hannen,

Here is my log from today.


Today I worked on finding the accurate timings for the length of a cache miss, as well as calculating the hit rates of various different access patterns and comparing the speed of the L1 cache to the last-level one.

Unexpected experience: When I actually got the cache miss timing, and it corresponded with the expected one!  After the difficulties with time-measuring the past few days, it was great to finally see it work.

Greatest challenge: I'm torn between the continued constant segfaults and the difficulty of coming up with an appropriate method to find the cache miss rate.  Neither are fun.


How does Wednesday at 11:30 sound?

Thanks,
T.J.

characterize program, analyze
there is great practical usage for this area

// all miss experiment
// cache model -- hits * hit + miss * miss penalty
//       2 levels of cache???
// AND SEND IT
