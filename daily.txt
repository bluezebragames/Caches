Today:

I made cache!

difficulty: My computer's about to die!!!!
difficulty: I definitely misunderstood the goal of the project


change the couting of hit and miss to a variable in Cache
       in order to deal with read/write hitting stuph

DEAL WITH ADDRESS VS INDEX (simple find/replace, but decide what to rename as)

DIRTY BIT (DO NOT FORGET THIS)





maybe start over???
      now that I know that I'm supposed to just take the addresses and see the miss rate, instead of actually doing the whole memory thing
