Today:


TODO: go back to the proposal
TODO: overarching lessons
TODO: improve pun
TODO: make the histogram from the data (googer?)
The cache class is the thing that models the cache, so it makes sense that it would be the longest file out of all of them.  And it is, but only by literally 10 lines of code

The test program is a program written to time things and to interface with the program that interfaces with the cache program.  Complicated, right?  It writes random lines of numbers to a file, whereupon another program reads those numbers and tells the model cache what to do with them.

*get image of output file, or if I really need to fill time, pull it up*
*random or sequential???*

But why am I timing and modeling in the first place?

It's annoying to do something and have it take forever, for not much reward :(







Dear Mr. Hannen,

Here's today's log.


Today I finished fixing the bugs that have plagued me from the beginning.  After learning how to correctly use gdb, the cool debugger thing that I downloaded a few days ago, I found the segfaults and corrected them (one was caused by an integer overflow, and the other one was something about the difference between % and /).

Biggest challenge: Incorrectly assuming that the segfaults were caused upon termination of the program, when in reality they were caused much earlier -- also, figuring out how to use gdb

Largest lesson: Never assume that what you already have written is right, because there's a pretty good chance it actually isn't.

I'll see you at 11:30 on Wednesday in your room, then.


Thanks,
T.J.

Largest lesson learned today
Biggest challenge faced today
An unexpected experience
A problem you solved & how it was solved
A failure that occurred and your response to it


characterize program, analyze
there is great practical usage for this area

// all miss experiment
// cache model -- hits * hit + miss * miss penalty
//       2 levels of cache???
// AND SEND IT
