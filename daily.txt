Today:

I started and completed the set-associative part of the cache project, and am now able to both read from and write to memory.  I am staying in contact with Mr. Hirano as I continue to make progress on the project.

Surprise:  He wants me to be really certain about my code, which I wasn't expecting.  Well, I expected that he'd want to make sure the code works, but the extent of it was a pleasant surprise?  Something like that.

Challenge: having to transition into the next portion of the project, which is very different from this one.  I'm glad that I get the weekend as a sort of switching time.

deal with 2d array initialization between cache.h and cache.cpp
instead of the current vector<> thing


okay i do not use index at all
also offset?  what about that thing?  is that set-associative?  do I need it?
